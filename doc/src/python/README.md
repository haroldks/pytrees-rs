A Python interface is available on [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/pytrees-rs/).
This interface allows you to utilize the various implemented algorithms with a Python
script, employing a simple and familiar approach and is compatible with Scikit-Learn pipelines.

## Installing From Pypi

Assuming you have Python 3.9 or 3.10 installed,
precompiled versions of the library are available on PyPI for macOS and Linux operating systems.
__Binaries for Windows versions will be available in the future__. To install the library, use:

```bash
pip install pytrees-rs
```

## Installing from source

After cloning the project as mentioned [here](../installation.md)  you'll find a subdirectory named **pytrees-rs**
containing the source code for the interface.

To install the interface in your Python environment, follow these instructions:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
cd pytrees-rs
pip install .
```
